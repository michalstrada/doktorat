	Abstract = {CoopnBuilder is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Concurrent Object Oriented Petri Nets (COOPN). It comes with a complete set of tools enabling the user to view, edit, check, simulate and generate code from CO-OPN specifications. The Code Generation tool allows the user to develop applications in an open way: the produced code can be integrated in larger projects or use existing libraries. The code generation will be emphasized in this paper, and we will focus on ease-of-use and extensibility. CoopnBuilder is an open-source Java program and can be downloaded from <a href=``http://cui.unige.ch/smv/''>http://cui.unige.ch/smv</a>},

	Abstract = {CO-OPN (Concurrent Object Oriented Petri Net) is a formal specification language for modelling distributed systems; it is based on coordinated algebraic Petri nets. In this paper we describe a method for generating an executable prototype from a CO-OPN specification. We focus our discussion on the generation of executable code for CO-OPN classes. CO-OPN classes are defined using Petri Nets. The main problems arise when implementing synchronization and non-determinism of CO-OPN classes in procedural languages. Our method proposes a solution to these problems. Another interesting aspect of our method is the easy integration of a generated prototype into any existing system. This paper focuses on the generation of Java code that fulfils the Java Beans component architecture, however our approach is also applicable to other object-oriented implementation languages with a component architecture.},

Much of the response to this RFP has focused on how the UML notation might be extended rather than how UML and MDA could be used during the conduct of systems engineering lifecycle process activities. In this paper we describe important concepts underlying the Executable/Translatable UML and how they and more traditional modeling concepts can be used to support the objectives of MDA in the Systems Engineering context.},

It is shown how the timed behaviors used as the basis for the denotational models of the language may be extracted from the operational semantics. Finally, the failures model for timed CSP is shown to be equivalent to may-testing and, thus, to trace congruence.},

@article{SunGueJez02,
	Abstract = {The Unified Modelling Language (UML) lacks precise and formal foundations and semantics for several modeling constructs, such as transition guards or method bodies. These semantic discrepancies and loopholes prevent executability, making early testing and validation out of reach of UML tools. Furthermore, the semantic gap from high-level UML concepts to low-level programming constructs found in traditional object-oriented language prevents the development of efficient code generators.The recent Action Semantics (AS) proposal tackles these problems by extending the UML with yet another formalism for describing behavior, but with a strong emphasis on dynamic semantics. This formalism provides both, a metamodel integrated into the UML metamodel, and a model of execution for these statements. As a future OMG standard, the AS eases the move to tool interoperability, and allows for executable modeling and simulation.We explore in this paper a specificity of the AS: its applicability to the UML metamodel, itself a UML model. We show how this approach paves the way for powerful metaprogramming for model transformation. Furthermore, the overhead for designers is minimal, as mappings from usual object-oriented languages to the AS will be standardized.},

	Abstract = {The Action Semantics for UML provides a standard and platform independent way to describe the behavior of methods and executable actions in object-oriented system design prior to implementation allowing the development of highly automated and optimized code generators for UML CASE tools. Model transformation systems provide visual but formal background to specify arbitrary transformations in the Model Driven Architecture (the leading trend in software engineering). In the current paper, we describe a general encoding of model transformation systems as executable Action Semantics expressions to provide a standard way for automatically generating the implementation of formal (and provenly correct) transformations by off-the-shelf MDA tools. In addition, we point out a weakness in the Action Semantics standard that must be improved to achieve a stand-alone and functionally complete action specification language.},

	Abstract = {The CSP paradigm is known as a powerful concept for designing and analysing the architectural and behavioural parts of concurrent software. Although the theory of CSP is useful for mathematicians, the programming language occam has been derived from CSP that is useful for any engineering practice. Nowadays, the concept of occam/CSP can be used for almost every object-oriented programming language. This paper describes a tree-based description model and prototype tool that elevates the use of occam/CSP concepts at design level and performs code generation for the level of implementation in Java, C/C++, and machine-readable CSP. The tool is a kind of browser that is able to assist modern workbenches (like Borland Builder, Microsoft Visual C++ and 20-SIM) with coding concurrency. The tree description model can be used to browse through the generated source code. The tool will guide the user through the design trajectory using supporting messages and several semantic and syntax rule checks. The machine-readable CSP can be read by FDR, enabling more advanced analysis on the design. Early experiments with the prototype tool show that the browser concept, combined with the tree description model, enables a user-friendly way to create a design using the CSP concepts and benefits. The design tool is available from our URL, http://www.rt.el.utwente.nl/javapp.},

In an earlier paper a Petri net model with four fuzzy set theoretic functions was introduced but no algorithms were given for computing the two important operators called earliest and latest. This paper first presents algorithms for performing these two operations on fuzzy functions of time, and then extends the existing concept of (real-time) metric temporal logic to fuzzy metric temporal logic by expressing the metrics for state and time constraints in terms of fuzzy possibility distributions. Finally, the two concepts of into fuzzy timing Petri nets and fuzzy metric temporal logic are combined to introduce a new Petri net model called the temporal-logic fuzzy timing Petri net (TLFTN). The paper concludes with an algorithm and illustrative example for model checking using TLFTNs.},

@article{venkatesh95,
	Abstract = {Flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs) are advanced manufacturing systems consisting of machining cells, robots, and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) that function under the hierarchical control of computers. The flexibility of an FMS is primarily imparted by integrating the functions of different system elements such as machining cells, robots, and AGVs using computers. Hence, the communication among computers, machining cells, robots, and AGVs in the FMS is important to realize the full benefits of FMSs. Despite the abundant literature on factory communications there is a need for integrated tools to model communication networks in FMS that can be used for both performance evaluation and real-time control. In this paper, the role of local area networks (LANs) in FMSs is explicated. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. With this aim first, the differences between the LANs in conventional computer systems to that of LANs in FMSs are emphasized. Secondly, real-time PNs are demonstrated as an integrated modeling tool for LAN in FMS. A software package has been developed to simulate the Petri net models (PNMs). The software package developed aids system designers by simulating the PNM and generating certain performance criteria. Furthermore, the same package assists control engineers for the real-time control of the system designed by system designers.},

Modeling is done using a graphical editor that follows the object oriented methodology proposed by Grady Booch, producing an ISO EXPRESS language specification of classes and relations of inheritance and use. This specification is the basis for integrating the broad field of aspects to be taken into account by different work groups and is a must for concurrent engineering to succeed. Design is achieved by graphical configuration of existing or new solutions that may be totally or partially developed. Automatic generation of code provides a basis for persistent objects through an ISO STEP object oriented database. Developers use these base classes to create their specific solutions and simulate interaction with other objects in a user friendly graphical environment. Repositories for commercial databases (ObjectStore, Oracle, etc.) and translators from CAD formats (DXF, IGES, Catia, etc.) are also available, allowing easy integration with other applications.

There are several reasons why two robots (or more) can be better than one: ffl Distributed Action: Many robots can be in many places at the same time ffl Inherent Parallelism: Many robots can do many, perhaps different things at the same time ffl Divide and Conquer: Certain problems are well suited for decomposition and allocation among many robots ffl Simpler is better: Often each agent in a team of robots can be simpler than a more comprehensive single robot solution No doubt there are more reasons as well. Unfortunately there are also drawbacks, in particular regarding coordination and elimination of interference. The degree of difficulty imposed depends heavily upon the task and the communication and control strategies chosen.},

Mobile robots, if they areto perform useful tasks andbecome accepted in open environments, must be fully autonomous. Autonomy has many different aspects; here we concentrate on three central ones: the ability to attend to another agent, to take advice about the environment, and to carry out assigned tasks. All three involve complex sensing and planning operations on the part of the robot, including the use of visual tracking of humans, coordination of motor controls, and planning. We show how these capabilities are integrated in the Saphira architecture, using the concepts of coordination of behavior, coherence of modeling, and communication with other agents.

	Abstract = {The 4D/RCS architecture provides a reference model for military unmanned vehicles on how their software components should be identified and organized. It defines ways of interacting to ensure that missions, especially those involving unknown or hostile environments, can be analyzed, decomposed, distributed, planned, and executed intelligently, effectively, efficiently and in coordination. To achieve this, the 4D/RCS reference model provides well defined and highly coordinated sensory processing, world modeling, knowledge management, cost/benefit analysis, behavior generation, and messaging functions, as well as the associated interfaces. The 4D/RCS architecture is based on scientific principles and is consistent with military hierarchical command doctrine.},
